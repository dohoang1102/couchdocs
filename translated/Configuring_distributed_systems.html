  <p>This is a stub for a page to discuss how to actually get couchdb running in a distributed fashion.</p>
<p>Distributed CouchDB implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CouchDB currently scales for reads, by allowing synchronization between multiple servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CouchDB does not currently support partitioning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(couch-dev post from Jan Lehnardt - July 2008)</p>
<pre><code>At the moment, CouchDB runs best on a single machine
with multiple machines for a cluster using replication to
synchronise data. Erlang allows a VM to run on multiple
machines and we do not yet take advantage of that fact.
This is an area that is worth investigating.

The road map is at http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/roadmap.html

... scaling parts are Future Feature work.
A couple of people have voiced interest in contributing there
especially the database partitioning, but nothing has come
out of that yet.
</code></pre>
<h2>Editorial Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>I see that there is replication via the 'replication' functionality on the http://localhost:5984/_utils console interface, but how does one distribute a database across, say 10 hosts?</li>
<li>Is there a way to specify the number of copies of a piece of data?  (Presumes not all hosts have copies of each piece of data)</li>
<li>Is there a piece of this that can be configured in the couch.ini file, such than when the topology changes (ie. server add or removal) that things can be put back into sync?</li>
</ul>
<p>Excerpts from the Architectural Document, http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/docs/overview.html :</p>
<pre><code>Using just the basic replication model, many traditionally single server database applications can be made distributed with almost no extra work.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Let's try to document this.  What do we mean by <strong>distributed</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Distributed defined</h3>
<p>Here's what some people might <em>assume</em> we mean by distributed data store:</p>
<ul>
<li>We (couchdb) have a client which will <strong>shard</strong> the data by key, and direct it to the correct server (shard), such that the writes of the system will <strong>scale</strong>.  That is that there are many <em>writers</em>, in a collision-free update environment.</li>
<li>Reads may scale if they outnumber the writes using some form of replication for read-only-clients.</li>
<li>If a master data store node is lost, then the client (or some proxy mechanism) can switch over to a new master data store, which is <em>really up to date</em> (ie. milliseconds), and the client will continue without a hitch.</li>
</ul>
