<h2 id="meet-couchdb">Meet CouchDB</h2>
<p>CouchDB is often categorized as a “NoSQL” database, a term that has become increasingly popular in late 2009, and early 2010.  While this is a rather generic, and sometimes offensive characterization of a database, or data store, it does clearly define a break from traditional SQL based databases.   CouchDB makes a clean break from the SQL database world in many ways.  One of the primary differences  is  the lack of a schema,  or rigid pre-defined data structures like tables.   Because the data stored in CouchDB is a JSON document(s), the structure of the data, or document(s), can change dynamically.  This greatly simplifies the maintenance and development of the database, especially over time when the data  and it's use evolve.  Additionally, CouchDB doesn't rely on SQL JOINS to merge related data.  This is often a point of contention with some users of SQL databases, but is generally a non-issue in CouchDB, as it's powerful Map/Reduce framework comes to the rescue.<br />
</p>
<p>CouchDB's departure from the SQL world isn't the only thing that makes CouchDB stand out among a growing list of “NoSQL”  databases available.  One of CouchDB's most powerful feature, is it's replication framework.  This replication framework provides a comprehensive set of features: </p>
<ul>
<li>Master → Slave replication</li>
<li>Master ↔ Maser replication</li>
<li>Filtered Replication</li>
<li>Incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection/resolution
These replication features can be used in combination to create powerful solutions to many problems in the IT industry, like reliability, and scalability.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-it-is-not">What it is Not</h2>
<ul>
<li>A relational database.</li>
<li>A replacement for relational databases.</li>
<li>An object-oriented database. Or more specifically, meant to function as a seamless persistence layer for an OO programming language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-characteristics">Key Characteristics</h2>
<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>
<p>A CouchDB document is a <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> object that consists of named fields. Field values may be strings, numbers, dates, or even ordered lists and associative maps. An example of a document would be a blog post:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;Subject&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I like Plankton&quot;</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;Author&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Rusty&quot;</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;PostedDate&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;5/23/2006&quot;</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;Tags&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;plankton&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;baseball&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;decisions&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;Body&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I decided today that I don&#39;t like baseball. I like plankton.&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>In the above example document, <code>Subject</code> is a field that contains a single string value "I like plankton". <code>Tags</code>  is a field containing the list of values "plankton",  "baseball", and "decisions".</p>
<p>A CouchDB database is a flat collection of these documents. Each document is identified by a unique ID.</p>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<p>To address this problem of adding structure back to semi-structured data, CouchDB integrates a view model using Javascript for description. Views are the method of aggregating and reporting on the documents in a database, and are built on-demand to aggregate, join and report on database documents. Views are built dynamically and don’t affect the underlying document, you can have as many different view representations of the same data as you like.</p>
<h3 id="schema-free">Schema-Free</h3>
<p>Unlike SQL databases which are designed to store and report on highly structured, interrelated data, CouchDB is designed to store and report on large amounts of semi-structured, document oriented data. CouchDB greatly simplifies the development of document oriented applications, which make up the bulk of collaborative web applications.</p>
<p>In an SQL database, as needs evolve the schema and storage of the existing data must be updated. This often causes problems as new needs arise that simply weren't anticipated in the initial database designs, and makes distributed  "upgrades" a problem for every host that needs to go through a schema update.</p>
<p>With CouchDB, no schema is enforced, so new document types with new meaning can be safely added alongside the old. The view engine, using Javascript, is designed to easily handle new document types and disparate but similar  documents.</p>
<h3 id="distributed">Distributed</h3>
<p>CouchDB is a peer based distributed database system. Any number of CouchDB hosts (servers and offline-clients) can have independent "replica copies" of the same database, where applications have full database interactivity (query, add, edit, delete). When back online or on a schedule, database changes are replicated bi-directionally.</p>
<p>CouchDB has built-in conflict detection and management and the replication process is incremental and fast, copying only documents and individual fields changed since the previous replication. Most applications require no special planning to take advantage of distributed updates and replication.</p>
<p>Unlike cumbersome attempts to bolt distributed features on top of the same legacy models and databases, it is the result of careful ground-up design, engineering and integration. The document, view, security and replication  models, the special purpose query language, the efficient and robust disk layout are all carefully integrated for a reliable and efficient system.</p>
