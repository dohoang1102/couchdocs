 * I'm currently into developing scalable solutions for the Finance Business. Seriously I'm working for Sungard in JPMorgan's Scalability team.

 * I've used couchDD in Credit-Suisse  as configuration and preference database. I'm currently using it as the portal and database of Syntazo's market data framework.
