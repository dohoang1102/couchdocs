Welcome to [[http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/|Apache CouchDB Project]] Wiki.

Apache CouchDB is a distributed, fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database accessible via a RESTful HTTP/JSON API. Among other features, it provides robust, incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection and resolution, and is queryable and indexable using a table-oriented view engine with !JavaScript acting as the default view definition language.
